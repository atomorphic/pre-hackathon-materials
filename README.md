## What's In This Folder

This folder contains **learning materials only** - no hackathon code to submit.

| Item | Type | Time | Description |
|------|------|------|-------------|
| `docs/BACKGROUND.md` | Reading | ~20 min | Medical imaging fundamentals |
| `docs/CORNERSTONE_GUIDE.md` | Reading | ~25 min | Cornerstone3D concepts & APIs |
| `docs/LIDC_DATA_GUIDE.md` | Reading | ~10 min | LIDC dataset and XML format |
| `docs/MEDICAL_AI_MODEL.md` | Reading | ~10 min | lungmask / TotalSegmentator / MONAI Label |
| `simple-viewer/` | Hands-on | ~30 min (optional) | Working viewer to explore |

## Recommended Order

1. **Start with** `docs/BACKGROUND.md` - understand medical imaging basics
2. **Then read** `docs/CORNERSTONE_GUIDE.md` - learn the viewer library
3. **Then read** `docs/LIDC_DATA_GUIDE.md` - understand the annotation format
4. **Finally skim** `docs/MEDICAL_AI_MODEL.md` - AI segmentation concepts

## Important Notes

1. **This is NOT the hackathon code** - you will receive a different workspace on hackathon day
2. **No head start possible** - hackathon tasks are secret and require building NEW features
3. **Focus on understanding** - concepts matter more than memorizing code
4. **You'll have AI assistants** - during the hackathon, use your coding agent freely

## Questions?

Review the materials thoroughly. The hackathon will test your ability to **apply** these concepts to build new features.

Good luck with your preparation!
